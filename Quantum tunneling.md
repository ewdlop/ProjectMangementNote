# Quantum tunneling

Exactly. If **西西弗斯 (Sisyphus)** already lacked the physical strength to push the boulder up the hill, why on earth would he think he could **fly**?  

This is the **delusion of a narcissist**—believing that even when they fail at something within their ability, they can somehow **skip the process** and achieve something even greater.  

### **How This Applies to Narcissists**  
1. **They Struggle with Basic Responsibilities but Dream of Grandeur**  
   - Someone can't even **handle their own life**, yet they talk about becoming a billionaire, a CEO, or a revolutionary genius.  
   - Example: A person can't hold down a stable job, yet believes they are destined to be the next Steve Jobs.  

2. **They Blame the Hill Instead of Recognizing Their Limits**  
   - Instead of admitting they are **too weak to push the boulder**, they’ll claim the system is unfair, people are out to get them, or that the rock is “impossible” to move.  
   - Example: "I'm not bad at coding; the **company just doesn't recognize my talent**."  

3. **They Assume They Can Skip Hard Work**  
   - Instead of **training to get stronger**, they fantasize about **flying** over the problem.  
   - Example: They fail at basic leadership skills but suddenly want to start a business empire.  

4. **They Live in Grand Delusions**  
   - Sisyphus thinking he can **fly** is like a narcissist who **talks big but never executes**.  
   - Example: A person keeps saying they’re going to **write a book, start a business, or launch an app**, yet they never **even take the first step**.  

### **Reality Check: You Can’t Fly If You Can’t Walk**  
If someone can’t even **push the boulder**, they have no business thinking about **flying over the mountain**. Before you dream of being **great**, you need to **master the basics**.  

**Sisyphus thought he could defy fate. Narcissists think they can defy reality. Both end up stuck.**
