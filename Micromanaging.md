# 越幫越忙

When narcissists accuse people of **越幫越忙 (making things worse by trying to help)**, they are often projecting their own incompetence, lack of accountability, or manipulative tendencies onto others. Here’s how they typically use this accusation:

### 1. **Shifting Blame**  
   - They refuse to acknowledge their own mistakes and instead blame others for “helping too much” or “interfering.”
   - Example: If they botched a project, they’ll say your advice confused them rather than admitting they didn’t plan properly.

### 2. **Undermining Others' Efforts**  
   - If someone is genuinely trying to help, a narcissist might frame it as a negative thing to maintain control.
   - Example: “If you hadn’t tried to ‘help,’ I would have done it better!” – even if they weren’t doing anything in the first place.

### 3. **Deflecting Criticism**  
   - They use this phrase to avoid taking responsibility for the failure of their own plans or decisions.
   - Example: Instead of admitting they made a bad financial decision, they might say, “Your suggestions just made it worse.”

### 4. **Gaslighting & Discouraging Others**  
   - By making someone feel like their help is always counterproductive, the narcissist subtly discourages them from offering any input in the future.
   - Example: “Every time you try to help, it just makes things worse. Just stop.” – This isolates the helper and strengthens the narcissist’s control.

### 5. **Maintaining the Victim Role**  
   - Narcissists love being seen as victims. If they say “越幫越忙,” they frame themselves as the poor soul constantly burdened by "useless" or "harmful" help.
   - Example: “You always meddle in my problems, and now look—it’s a disaster because of you!”  

### 🔥 **How to Respond?**  
- **Call out the manipulation:** “If my help wasn’t useful, why didn’t you communicate that earlier?”  
- **Refuse to play their game:** “I was trying to help, but it seems like you already had a plan. I’ll step back.”  
- **Set Boundaries:** “I won’t waste my time helping if you’re just going to complain about it later.”  

At the end of the day, narcissists don’t want help—they want control.

## Yeah like a personal project and they dont are afraid of the unknown

Exactly. When narcissists accuse others of **越幫越忙** in the context of a **personal project**, it’s often because they:  

1. **Fear the Unknown & Feel Insecure**  
   - They don’t want to admit they don’t know something, so instead of acknowledging their fear, they turn it into **your fault** for making things more complicated.  
   - Example: They struggle with a coding project, you suggest a more efficient way, and suddenly, *you’re the reason they’re struggling* because “your advice confused them.”  

2. **Want to Maintain Control & Ownership**  
   - A narcissist **hates** when someone else contributes something better or provides a new perspective. It threatens their illusion of being the “expert.”  
   - Example: You suggest an improvement, and instead of appreciating it, they dismiss it as "too complicated" or say "you’re making things worse."  

3. **Use It as an Excuse to Avoid Failure**  
   - If their project is failing, instead of admitting it’s beyond their skills or effort, they’ll **blame your help** for “messing it up.”  
   - Example: “I had everything under control until you suggested that new approach. Now I’m lost.”  

4. **Deflect Their Own Fear of the Unknown**  
   - Narcissists don’t handle uncertainty well because they associate it with **losing control**. Rather than face it, they accuse you of making things harder.  
   - Example: They’re too afraid to learn a new framework, so when you suggest it, they go: *“Why would you even bring that up? That’s just making things worse.”*  

### 🔥 **How to Deal with This?**  
✔ **Let them struggle** – If they don’t want your help, don’t waste your time.  
✔ **Don’t take the blame** – Say: *"I was just offering a perspective. You’re in control, so do what works for you."*  
✔ **Call out the contradiction** – “If you already knew what to do, why did my suggestion ‘make it worse’?”  

At the end of the day, **they just want control, not solutions.**
